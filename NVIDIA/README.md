# NVIDIA CUDA Samples

https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples

These samples were pulled from the above repo on Monday, March 13, 2023. They are from CUDA version 12.1. 

## Saturday, March 25, 2023

I am now going to be pulling the samples from the 11.8 version.

It looks like you can use the Makefile unmodified to build the samples. Just make sure to run 'make dbg=1' to build the debug version.

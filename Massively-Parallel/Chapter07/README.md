    Certainly, I'll break down and explain the key components of the CUDA program for 2D convolution using the Optimized Parallel Tiled Approach:

    1. Constants and Includes:
    ```cuda
    #define TILE_SIZE 16
    #define MASK_SIZE 3
    #define MASK_RADIUS MASK_SIZE / 2
    ```
    These define the size of the tile (16x16) and the convolution mask (3x3). The MASK_RADIUS is used for padding calculations.

    2. Constant Memory for Mask:
    ```cuda
    __constant__ float d_Mask[MASK_SIZE * MASK_SIZE];
    ```
    This declares the convolution mask in constant memory, which is cached and optimized for read-only access across threads.

    3. CUDA Kernel:
    ```cuda
    __global__ void convolution2DTiled(float* d_Input, float* d_Output, int width, int height)
    ```
    This is the main convolution kernel that implements the tiled approach.

    4. Shared Memory Declaration:
    ```cuda
    __shared__ float s_Input[TILE_SIZE + MASK_SIZE - 1][TILE_SIZE + MASK_SIZE - 1];
    ```
    This declares shared memory for the input tile, including padding for the halo region.

    5. Thread and Block Index Calculation:
    ```cuda
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;
    int bx = blockIdx.x * TILE_SIZE;
    int by = blockIdx.y * TILE_SIZE;
    int x = bx + tx;
    int y = by + ty;
    ```
    These calculate the global and local indices for each thread.

    6. Loading Input Tile into Shared Memory:
    ```cuda
    for (int i = ty; i < TILE_SIZE + MASK_SIZE - 1; i += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (int j = tx; j < TILE_SIZE + MASK_SIZE - 1; j += TILE_SIZE) {
            // ... (loading logic)
        }
    }
    ```
    This section loads the input tile into shared memory, including the halo region. It handles boundary conditions by setting out-of-bounds values to zero.

    7. Thread Synchronization:
    ```cuda
    __syncthreads();
    ```
    This ensures all threads have finished loading data into shared memory before proceeding.

    8. Convolution Computation:
    ```cuda
    if (x < width && y < height) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < MASK_SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < MASK_SIZE; j++) {
                sum += s_Input[ty + i][tx + j] * d_Mask[i * MASK_SIZE + j];
            }
        }
        d_Output[y * width + x] = sum;
    }
    ```
    This performs the actual convolution computation using the data in shared memory and the mask in constant memory.

    9. Host Function for Mask Initialization:
    ```cuda
    void initializeMask(float* mask)
    ```
    This function initializes the convolution mask on the host.

    10. Main Function:
        - Allocates host and device memory
        - Initializes input data and mask
        - Copies data to the device
        - Sets up grid and block dimensions
        - Launches the kernel
        - Copies results back to the host
        - Cleans up allocated memory

    11. Kernel Launch:
        ```cuda
        convolution2DTiled<<<dimGrid, dimBlock>>>(d_Input, d_Output, width, height);
        ```
        This launches the convolution kernel with the calculated grid and block dimensions.

    The key optimizations in this code are:
    1. Use of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
    2. Use of constant memory for the mask, which is cached and optimized for broadcast
    3. Tiled approach to maximize data reuse within each thread block
    4. Coalesced memory access patterns for efficient global memory transactions

    These optimizations help to significantly improve the performance of the 2D convolution operation on the GPU.

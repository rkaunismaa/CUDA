I asked [Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/db760a6f-a34f-4e0a-9256-01a50977b482) the question "For CUDA tiled matrix multiplication, of the possible range of values for BLOCK_SIZE, for what values of BLOCK_SIZE will the kernel completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory? (You need to consider only square blocks.)" and it responded with this:

      To determine the BLOCK_SIZE values that completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory in CUDA tiled matrix multiplication with square blocks, we need to consider the memory access patterns and the requirements for coalesced memory access in CUDA.

      For coalesced memory access in CUDA:

      1. The threads in a warp should access contiguous memory addresses.
      2. The first address of the memory access should be aligned to 32, 64, or 128 bytes (depending on the CUDA compute capability).

      In tiled matrix multiplication:

      1. When loading data from global memory to shared memory, we access the input matrices.
      2. When writing the result back to global memory, we access the output matrix.

      Let's analyze these accesses:

      1. Reading from the first input matrix (usually called A):
         - These accesses are generally coalesced because threads in a warp read consecutive elements in a row.

      2. Reading from the second input matrix (usually called B):
         - These accesses can be uncoalesced if not handled properly, as threads in a warp read elements in a column.

      3. Writing to the output matrix (usually called C):
         - These accesses are generally coalesced because threads in a warp write to consecutive elements in a row.

      The main concern is reading from matrix B. To ensure coalesced access, we need the BLOCK_SIZE to be a multiple of the warp size (32 for most CUDA GPUs).

      Therefore, the values of BLOCK_SIZE that will completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory are:

      32, 64, 96, 128, ...

      In practice, however, very large block sizes are not efficient due to limitations in shared memory and register usage. Common BLOCK_SIZE values used in practice are 32 and 64.

      It's worth noting that modern CUDA architectures (compute capability 3.0 and above) have more relaxed coalescing rules and can better handle some types of uncoalesced accesses. However, adhering to these BLOCK_SIZE values will ensure the best performance across all CUDA architectures.

      Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or discuss related aspects of CUDA memory access patterns?

I then asked Claude to "Customize this document for a 4090 GPU" and got this:

      Certainly. Let's customize the response for an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, which uses the Ada Lovelace architecture and has compute capability 8.9.

      For the RTX 4090 specifically:

      1. Warp size: 32 threads (unchanged from previous generations)
      2. Maximum threads per block: 1024
      3. Maximum shared memory per block: 48 KB
      4. L1 cache/shared memory configuration: 128 KB combined, configurable

      Given these specifications, let's reconsider the BLOCK_SIZE for tiled matrix multiplication:

      1. The BLOCK_SIZE should still be a multiple of the warp size (32) to ensure coalesced memory access.

      2. The Ada Lovelace architecture has improved memory coalescing and caching mechanisms, which can better handle some uncoalesced accesses. However, adhering to coalesced access patterns is still beneficial for optimal performance.

      3. The larger L1 cache (which can be configured as shared memory) allows for potentially larger tile sizes.

      Optimal BLOCK_SIZE values for the RTX 4090 could be:

      32, 64, 96, 128

      While larger values like 160 or 192 are technically possible, they may not be practical due to resource constraints and diminishing returns.

      For the RTX 4090, a BLOCK_SIZE of 64 or 128 might be particularly effective:

      - 64: This allows for 16 warps per block (512 threads), which can help hide memory latency and increase occupancy.
      - 128: This utilizes the larger shared memory capacity of the RTX 4090, potentially reducing global memory accesses.

      It's important to note that the RTX 4090's advanced hardware features like larger L2 cache (96 MB) and higher memory bandwidth can mitigate some of the performance impact of uncoalesced accesses. However, maintaining coalesced access patterns is still crucial for achieving peak performance.

      To find the optimal BLOCK_SIZE for a specific matrix multiplication task on the RTX 4090, it's recommended to experiment with different values (32, 64, 96, 128) and benchmark the performance, as the best size can depend on the specific dimensions of your matrices and other characteristics of your computation.

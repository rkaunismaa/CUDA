I asked [Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/db760a6f-a34f-4e0a-9256-01a50977b482) the question "For CUDA tiled matrix multiplication, of the possible range of values for BLOCK_SIZE, for what values of BLOCK_SIZE will the kernel completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory? (You need to consider only square blocks.)" and it responded with this:

      To determine the BLOCK_SIZE values that completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory in CUDA tiled matrix multiplication with square blocks, we need to consider the memory access patterns and the requirements for coalesced memory access in CUDA.

      For coalesced memory access in CUDA:

      1. The threads in a warp should access contiguous memory addresses.
      2. The first address of the memory access should be aligned to 32, 64, or 128 bytes (depending on the CUDA compute capability).

      In tiled matrix multiplication:

      1. When loading data from global memory to shared memory, we access the input matrices.
      2. When writing the result back to global memory, we access the output matrix.

      Let's analyze these accesses:

      1. Reading from the first input matrix (usually called A):
         - These accesses are generally coalesced because threads in a warp read consecutive elements in a row.

      2. Reading from the second input matrix (usually called B):
         - These accesses can be uncoalesced if not handled properly, as threads in a warp read elements in a column.

      3. Writing to the output matrix (usually called C):
         - These accesses are generally coalesced because threads in a warp write to consecutive elements in a row.

      The main concern is reading from matrix B. To ensure coalesced access, we need the BLOCK_SIZE to be a multiple of the warp size (32 for most CUDA GPUs).

      Therefore, the values of BLOCK_SIZE that will completely avoid uncoalesced accesses to global memory are:

      32, 64, 96, 128, ...

      In practice, however, very large block sizes are not efficient due to limitations in shared memory and register usage. Common BLOCK_SIZE values used in practice are 32 and 64.

      It's worth noting that modern CUDA architectures (compute capability 3.0 and above) have more relaxed coalescing rules and can better handle some types of uncoalesced accesses. However, adhering to these BLOCK_SIZE values will ensure the best performance across all CUDA architectures.

      Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or discuss related aspects of CUDA memory access patterns?

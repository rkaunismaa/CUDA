# CUDA
My CUDA learning journey.

## Monday, March 13, 2023

This journey begins with a walk through of the 'CUDA Training Series' by the OAK RIDGE National Laboratory. https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/

The repository for this course is found at https://github.com/olcf/cuda-training-series

The relevant code will be pulled from that repository into the CUDA-Training-Series folder of this repository.

All work will be done using Visual Studio Code.
